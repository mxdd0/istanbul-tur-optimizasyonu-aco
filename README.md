# Istanbul Tour Route Optimization using Ant Colony Optimization (Scenario 6)

This project was developed as part of the **BLG-307 Artificial Intelligence Systems** course.
* **Student:** Bahadır Beldek
* **Student ID:** 2112721066

## Project Description
This project aims to generate an optimal daily tour route that minimizes the total travel distance across 15 historical landmarks in Istanbul for a tour company. The route planning is modeled and solved using the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm.

### Features
* **Algorithm:** Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
* **Interface:** Streamlit (Interactive Web Interface)
* **Mapping:** Dynamic route visualization using Folium
* **Data:** Real geographic coordinates of 15 locations in Istanbul
